# Flask Chat Application

This is a Chat Application I'm building with Flask, and SocketIO. I am just going to set up a simple chat web application that persists users, messages and groups. Stretch features include, image messaging, video and voice chat, and end-to-end encryption, and message editing.

## Minimum Viable Product
- Users, Groups, Messages, GroupUser Models
    - A group has many messages, a message belongs to a group
    - A user has many messages, a message belongs to a user
    - A user has many Groups through GroupUsers
    - A GroupUser belongs to a User
    - A GroupUser belongs to a Group
- Full CRUD Users, Groups, Messages
